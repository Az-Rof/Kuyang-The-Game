## 📜 Lore: The Legend of Kuyang

The Kuyang is a vampiric creature from Indonesian and Malay folklore. By day, they appear as normal humans, but at night, their head detaches from their body, trailing their internal organs as they fly through the darkness in search of blood—particularly that of pregnant women and newborns. 

According to legend, the Kuyang's power is passed down through generations, often unwillingly. The only way to stop a Kuyang is to find its body and fill the neck cavity with glass shards or thorny branches, preventing the head from reattaching.
