A 2D stealth-platformer game where you play as the **Kuyang**, a terrifying mythical creature from Indonesian folklore. Your goal: kidnap a baby while avoiding vigilant humans.

## 📖 About The Game

Nightfall: Kuyang Quest flips the traditional horror script. Instead of running *from* the monster, you *are* the monster.
This game was the final project for the MSIB Game Design & Development program at Infinite Learning. It combines RPG, Platformer, and Stealth genres, challenging the player to navigate a 2D environment, avoid detection by patrolling NPCs, and complete your sinister objective.

## ✨ Features

- 👻 **Play As The Monster:** Experience the power of the Kuyang, complete with unique abilities.
- 🤫 **Stealth Gameplay:** Avoid detection by humans (NPCs) who will patrol and give chase if they spot you.
- 🩸 **Blood Collection Mechanic:** Collect blood to fill your meter.
- 💨 **Invisibility Power:** Reach 80% blood to unlock the invisibility ability to sneak past the baby's parents.
- 💡 **Camouflage:** Hide inside electronic objects in the room to avoid humans.
- 🧠 **Reactive Enemy AI:** NPCs will patrol, chase the player, and react to sounds (like the baby crying).

## 🎯 Gameplay

You are the Kuyang. Your main goal is to kidnap the baby inside the house.

### Objectives
- **Avoid Detection:** Stay out of sight of the patrolling humans.
- **Collect Blood:** Find blood sources to fill your meter.
- **Unlock Invisibility:** Use this power to sneak by unseen.
- **Hide & Camouflage:** Use objects in the room to hide and wait for the right moment.

## 📜 Lore: The Legend of Kuyang

The Kuyang is a vampiric creature from Indonesian and Malay folklore. By day, they appear as normal humans, but at night, their head detaches from their body, trailing their internal organs as they fly through the darkness in search of blood—particularly that of pregnant women and newborns.
